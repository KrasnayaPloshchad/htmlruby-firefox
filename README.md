HTML Ruby for Firefox
================

HTML Ruby adds crude support for ruby annotation in Firefox. Both basic and complex ruby annotation in (X)HTML and HTML5 are supported. Writing mode and CSS3 ruby module is not supported.

Download and Install
---------------------
Download both Mozilla-approved release and cutting-edge development versions for Firefox from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/html-ruby/). Please uninstall or disable XHTML Ruby Support while HTML Ruby is enabled (and vice versa) to avoid conflicts.
